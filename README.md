# Ventifact's Linear Algebra
A repository for the series on writing a Linear Algebra library available here: https://medium.com/ventifacts-linear-algebra.

This was originally forked from a first-attempt many months ago, which you can freely look at over here: https://github.com/JoshFourie/qlogic-rs.
